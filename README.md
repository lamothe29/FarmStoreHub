# FarmStoreHub
A project that demonstrates using interfaces and abstract classes to represent the activity/tasks of a farm store company.

That farm store would need to do a few simple things including the following: hiring employees, paying employees, advertising, selling product, and sourcing product.

This set of java files shows a start to some basic functionality of a franchise of farm stores. It allows for things like adding items to the cart and to "finalize the purchase" (Which implies taking each item from the cart and adding it to another list called "owned" and then removing it from the cart). 

Next steps in extending this set of code is to add functionality for other processes.
